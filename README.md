# DEPRECATED
 - Since MongoInspector evolved beyond an inspection tool, I am changing its name to Mongol. 
 - See https://github.com/msavin/Mongol

# MongoInspector
 - Visual browser for your client-side Mongo Collections
 - Live Demo: http://mongoinspector.meteor.com

# Main Benefits
 - Watch your collections update in real-time in the browser
 - Click on a collection to browse its documents
 - Click on the title to minimize it or remove it
 - Does not compile into production code
 - Automatically detects your collections

# What people are saying: 
 - "This is so useful, no more typing in the console to look at collections :)"
 - "Nice tool to inspect your databases"
 - "This rocks! So insanely handy and so easy to install. "
